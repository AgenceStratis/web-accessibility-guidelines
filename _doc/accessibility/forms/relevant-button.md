## Explanation

The buttons, input `type="submit"`, input `type="reset"` or `button` must have relevant texts that allow the user to understand the action of the button. They are essential especially for blind users so that they can be sure of the action they are taking. For example, terms such as "submit", "ok", "validate"... will not be relevant enough. On the other hand, relevant texts explain the action, for example: "Subscribe to the newsletter", "Book my tickets online".

To make the button texts relevant, you can either make the text contained in the `value` attribute explicit or add a `title` on the element to make it explicit.
