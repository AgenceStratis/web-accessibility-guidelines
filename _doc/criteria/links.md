## Links

Provide explicit [link text](glossary.html#mIntituleLien), through [context](glossary.html#mContexteLien) information if needed, and use the [link title](glossary.html#mTitreLien) as sparsely as possible.

For a visually impaired user who does not have a global view of the page, it is essential to understand the function of a link. Indeed, the visual context and proximity of information are not always available to these blind or partially sighted users.

For users with cognitive disabilities, weak links do not encourage action. The user does not know and does not understand which page he is going to if the title of the link does not explain it sufficiently.

When the links are made up of single images, it is the alternative text of the image that constitutes the title of the link. At this point, the alternative text to be filled in is no longer the description of the image, but the destination of the link. If the image has no alternative, then the link is an empty link. For example, a user who navigates by voice will not be able to click on this link, not knowing how to name it.

### Synthesis
* Beware of empty links.
* Define relevant link titles.
* Respect the construction of link titles.
