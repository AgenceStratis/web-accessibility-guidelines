The web was designed to be accessible. Accessibility is not a recent field of expertise, it has existed since the beginning of the Web.
In 1997, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) created the WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative), which aims to propose technical solutions to make web technologies accessible to people with disabilities.
The first WCAG 1.0 standard was released in a stable version in 1999.
There are 4 standards:
* Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), the accessibility of web content;
* Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG), accessibility of CMS;
* User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG), accessibility of technical assistance and browsers;
* XML Accessibility Guidelines (XAG), accessibility of XML applications.
