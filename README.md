The [Web Accessibility Guidelines](https://stevenmouret.github.io/web-accessibility-guidelines/) (WAG) are Github pages that try to explain how to produce accessible content.
The content of the WAG is strongly inspired by the work of the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) the  and the [RGAA (fr)](https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/rgaa-accessibilite/) which is a French repository.
