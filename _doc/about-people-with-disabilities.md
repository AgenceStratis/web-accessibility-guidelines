# About people with disabilities

A problem in accessibility is the result of an interaction between an user and the content (or functionality) that he or she tried to access, use, perceive or understand but couldn't because of a disability.

Looking beyond people's disability, everyone is different and it would be meaningless to describe all the accessibility problems resulting from the content and functionalities of a site or web application lacking adaptability.

This first part focuses on what difficulties people will encounter during their experience or what kind of interaction will disrupt their experience.
