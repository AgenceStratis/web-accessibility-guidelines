#### Paragraphe

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

Donec id pulvinar ligula. Donec nulla metus, aliquet quis eleifend a, rutrum eget nisi. Maecenas condimentum sodales placerat. Donec elementum libero ac est dapibus hendrerit. Sed in dictum lorem. Integer congue erat diam. Aliquam turpis ex, congue non tempor non, porttitor id magna. Cras consequat orci enim, a congue arcu rhoncus eget.

#### Lists

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

#### Code

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
const var = 'String';
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
