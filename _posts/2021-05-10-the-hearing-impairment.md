Hearing impairments range from mild to moderate hearing loss to tinnitus in one or both ears ("hearing loss") to total loss of both ears that cannot be corrected ("deafness").<br>
Some people with hearing loss can hear sounds but not necessarily enough to understand speech, especially in a noisy environment.

There is no specific assistive technology for the web, and people with hearing loss use hearing aids to modulate sound to suit their disability.

Therefore, it will be necessary to provide alternatives to videos with sound and sound files such as closed captioning and text transcription.

It should be noted that deaf people whose natural language is Sign Language (LSF Langue des Signes Fran√ßaise for France) have a poor command of writing and reading because learning is more complicated.
