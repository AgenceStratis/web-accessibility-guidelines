General informations about the RGAA (Référentiel Général d'Accessibilité pour les Administrations)
{: .article-header__teaser}

The rules for web content accessibility, which are proposed through this repository, are based on the WCAG 2.0, written by the WAI.

WCAG 2.0 adopts a thematic approach proposing 12 structuring rules according to 4 fundamental principles.

WCAG explains what is needed but not how to do it. The RGAA is a method of applying WCAG.

The RGAA criteria are structured into 13 themes

* Images
* Frames
* Colors
* Multimedia
* Tables
* Links
* Scripts
* Mandatory elements
* Information structure
* Presentation of information
* Forms
* Navigation
* Consultation

Like in the WCAG, the RGAA has 3 levels of accessibility, A, AA, AAA.

French law and European Union requires compliance with levels A and AA. In this training we will therefore only cover the required levels A and AA.
