# Forms

For each form, associate each field with its label, group fields in similar blocks of information, structure selection lists in a consistent way, give each button an explicit label. Check that input help is available, ensure that the input control is accessible and that the user can control financial, legal or personal data.

## Synthesis
* Define relevant labels.
* Use a compliant method to link the fields to their respective labels.
* For required fields with an input format, always remember to indicate it (preferably in the field label).
* For input errors, link the error to the relevant field and provide an example of actual input when necessary.
