# Mental disability

## Persons with mental, cognitive or psychological disabilities

These users are the most difficult to support, as there is a wide variety of problematic situations caused by disabilities and very few or no assistive technologies adapted for these situations.

### Main difficulties encountered

Users with mental disabilities have limited comprehension and or difficulties to learn. These factors show that it is not easy for them to understand or follow complex content or processes, as an example, completing administrative forms can be a hassle for them. In some cases, the use of playback devices can be useful for their understanding.

People with cognitive or psychological deficits may experience difficulties with focus and/or memory, so it will be hard for them to use too rich interfaces, or content with moving or flashing elements. There is no efficient assistive technology to help these users, although it can be noted that some plugins offer features with the intent to simplify the display of elements or content.
