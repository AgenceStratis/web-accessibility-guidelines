**Impact:** Strong to major

**Users mainly impacted:** Blind, visually impaired, motor, mental and cognitive disabilities.

**RGAA criteria:** [Criterion 8.5 [A]](http://disic.github.io/rgaa_referentiel_en/criteria.html#crit-8-5) - [Criterion 8.6 [A]](http://disic.github.io/rgaa_referentiel_en/criteria.html#crit-8-6)

### Explanation

Page titles are the first information available to users and serve as the basis for browsers to produce a navigation history or list of open tabs.

In their absence or irrelevance, the blind, the severely visually impaired and the mentally or cognitively handicapped will have great difficulty finding a page in the navigation history or in the list of open tabs.

When pages are part of a process, blind and severely visually impaired people who use a screen reader may not understand the process.

Finally, when the page is bookmarked, the absence of a title or lack of relevance will force these users to systematically modify the proposed title, which can make the use of a site complex, especially for people with motor disabilities.

Consider making the page title relevant in the case of a process.
</div>

#### Page title of a list view

Imagine that we have 28 results in total with 10 results displayed per page and we are on the second page.

The title of the page could be `News - Page 2 to 3 - Name of my website`.

#### Page title of a search result

Following a search, there are several results.

The title of the page could be `Search results for the term(s) city - 7 results | Name of the website`
