## Mental disability

### Persons with mental, cognitive or psychological disabilities

These users are the most difficult to support, as there is a wide variety of disability situations and few or no assistive technologies adapted to these situations.

#### Main difficulties encountered

Users with mental disabilities will have limited comprehension difficulties or learning abilities that do not allow them to understand or follow complex content or processes, for example, the entry of administrative forms. In some cases, the use of vocalization devices can be a useful aid to understanding.

People with cognitive or psychological deficits may experience difficulties in concentration, memory or attention, for example, that do not allow them to use interfaces that are too rich or have moving or flashing elements. There is no effective assistive technology to help these users, although some plugins offer features that are intended to simplify the display of content.
