Web accessibility means that websites, tools and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.

4 principles:
* Perceivable, available through sight, hearing, or touch.
* Operable: compatible with keyboard, mouse and other technical assistance.
* Understandable: easy to comprehend.
* Robust: content is compatible with different browsers and assistive technologies.
