Do not provide [information through color](glossary.html#mInfoCouleur) only, and use sufficient color [contrasts](glossary.html#mContraste).

**Main users impacted:** The main users impacted are the blind and severely visually impaired and the visually impaired who have colour or contrast perception problems.

Colors are an important issue for users who do not perceive colors at all, especially people who are blind, have very low vision or who have color vision deficiencies (color blindness for example).

Color is sometimes the only vector used to provide information. For example, in a list, you have set the required elements in red and left the optional elements in black. A user who can not see these colors will not have access to this information. You must always provide another means, and preferably textual, so that all users, regardless of their ability to perceive, can access this information.

Another issue related to color concerns contrasts. For a user who has difficulty perceiving contrasts, some writings may be impossible to read if the writing color is not sufficiently contrasted with the background color.
