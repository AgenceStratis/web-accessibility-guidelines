## Frames

Provide each [inline frame](glossary.html#mCadreEnLigne) with a relevant title.
{: .article-header__teaser}

Screen readers have advanced features for quick navigation by type of elements in the page or through a list of page elements.

In both these two navigation modes, the lack of frame identification can cause problems in locating the page structure or understanding the content for the blind.

### Synthesis
* Give a relevant title to inline frame.
