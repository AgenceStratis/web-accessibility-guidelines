## Explanation

The moving text will not be read by people with reading difficulties if it slides too quickly. It can distract people with attention deficit and prevent them from reading the rest of the text on the page. For people using a screen reader, moving text can sometimes prevent the screen reader from rendering the content of the page.

Moving or blinking contents must at least check one of these conditions:
* The duration of the movement or blinking is less than or equal to 5 seconds.
* The user can stop **and** restart the movement or blinking.
* The user can show **and** hide the moving or blinking content.
* The user can display all the information without moving or blinking content.
