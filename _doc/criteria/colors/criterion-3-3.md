### Explanation

Color contrasts refer to the contrast ratio between the writing color of a text and its background color.

These contrasts concern:

* the texts you enter in the editor;
* the texts present in the images;
* the texts embedded in the videos.

There are values that provide sufficient minimum contrast for a large proportion of users with color perception difficulties.

To evaluate the contrasts of the elements you insert, you can use tools:

* [Color Contrast Analyzer](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/) thanks to a pipette, you can go and pick colours from all document formats (web, office, video, etc.) for analysis;
* Lighthouse in Google Chrome browser allows you to quickly check your web page for text content.
