There is a wide range of intellectual, cognitive and mental disabilities.<br>
For example, cognitive and learning disabilities affect perception, memory, language, attention, problem solving and understanding.

Therefore, care should be taken to ensure that:
* content can be presented in different ways;
* make it easier for users to see and hear the content;
* allow sufficient time for the user to read and use the content;
* provide navigational aids;
* ensure that content can be read and understood;
* help users avoid and correct errors.

There are assistive technologies to interact with content, such as:
* screen reader to hear information as it is read;
* resizing text and spacing;
* grammatical or syntactic assistance software for writing.
