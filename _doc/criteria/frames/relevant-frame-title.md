### Explanation

When you embed content from other websites via iframes, you must implement a title attribute on these frames that identify the content.

You must give them sufficient information so that they know what types of content they will find there.

In the case of technical frameworks, which are not visible and are only useful for data management by scripts, a generic title on the "Technical iframe" template is sufficient.
