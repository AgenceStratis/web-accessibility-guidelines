## Criterion 1.1 [A] <span>Does each image have a [text alternative](../glossary.html#mAltTexteImg)?</span>
{: .article-header__title}
</header>

**Impact:** Major

**Users mainly impacted:** Blind, severely visually impaired.

All images must have an alt attribute, which is due to the fact that in the absence of this attribute, a screen reader returns the path or name of the source file, which makes no sense to the user.
