## About persons with disabilities

A disability situation is the result of an interaction between a user and content (or functionality) that, because of a disability, makes it impossible for the user to access, perceive, understand or use it.

Beyond the deficiencies, everyone is different and it would be futile to try to describe all the disability situations resulting from a lack of adaptation of the content and functionalities of a site or a web application.

However, this first part focuses on the main difficulties and modes of interaction that characterise the disability situations experienced by these users.
