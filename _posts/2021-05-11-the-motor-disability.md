There is a wide diversity of disability situations for people with motor difficulties. Here are some current situations encountered in a web context:
* inability to use a pointer (mouse) or on the contrary to use a keyboard,
* difficulties in grasping objects by hand (paralysis) and in controlling movements (tremors, involuntary movements),
* difficulty in linking several actions or using key combinations.

There is a wide variety of technical assistance available:
* simple mechanical assistance (head-stick, adapted keyboards),
* more complex assistance (joysticks, trackball, foot mouse),
* voice controls, eye-tracking.
