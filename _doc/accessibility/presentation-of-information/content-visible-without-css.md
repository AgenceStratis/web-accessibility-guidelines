### Explanation

Background images inserted in CSS (`background` or `background-image`) must never be informative.
This information cannot be retrieved by screen readers or voice magnifiers.

*It is possible to transmit the information conveyed by the image via hidden text, however this technique is not recommended. This technique does not allow some devices to read content such as some high contrast modes.*
