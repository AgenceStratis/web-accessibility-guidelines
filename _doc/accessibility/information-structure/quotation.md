## Explanation

Failure to report quotations can make the content more complex for blind and severely visually impaired people to understand and generate ambiguities and misunderstandings.

Correctly marking a quote allows users who are visually impaired, blind or have difficulty reading and who use a screen reader to understand that it is a quote and to find precisely the beginning and end of the quote, without having to search through all the characters for opening and closing quotation marks.

There are two types of quotations:

* short quotations, called online quotations;
* long quotations, called block quotations.
