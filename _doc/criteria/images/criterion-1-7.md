## Criterion 1.7 [A] <span>For each [image conveying information](../glossary.html#mImgInfo) with a [detailed description](../glossary.html#mDescDetaillee), is this description relevant?</span>
{: .article-header__title}
</header>

**Impact:** Major

**Users mainly impacted:** Blind, severely visually impaired.

### Explanation

This criterion will ensure that the detailed description is relevant.

When facing an image with a detailed description, one must ask oneself the question:

**What information does this image want to convey?**

For example for a map it is useless to describe all the streets, parking, buildings... It is necessary to understand the meaning and interest of this map.

#### Example of complex image with detailed description

Below is an example of a complex image. This is a location plan. An alternative text is not sufficient to transcribe all the information on this plan.
