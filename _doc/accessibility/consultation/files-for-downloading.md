### Explanation

Blind and severely visually impaired people will have great difficulty if the documents to be downloaded are not accessible or if they do not have an accessible alternative.

#### Warn the user about the nature of the file

This information allows users to understand that this is a downloadable document and to know its characteristics.
Knowing the file format allows the user to know in advance if he or she will be able to use it (open and browse it).
As for the weight, it allows him to know if he will be able to get it back.
The user may be roaming and not have the appropriate software or connection.

It is necessary to provide the user with the following information:

* The weight of the document;
* the format (pdf, docx, xlsx...);
* the language if it is different from the language of the website.

<div class="important">

When documents for downloading are generated on the fly and it is not possible to define the weight of the document, it is accepted that only the format is indicated. If a weight estimate is possible, it is advisable to indicate this.

#### Make downloadable documents accessible or propose an accessible alternative

If possible, it is necessary to make a document accessible for download. If the software used to create the document is not compatible with accessibility, it is necessary to provide an accessible equivalent in another format (.doc,.odt... or a web page).
